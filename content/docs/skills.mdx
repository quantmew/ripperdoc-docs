Skills are reusable instruction bundles that extend Ripperdoc's capabilities for specific tasks.

## What are Skills?

Skills provide:
- Specialized instructions for the AI
- Tool restrictions or allowances
- Custom model hints
- Domain-specific knowledge

## Skill Locations

Skills are loaded from:

1. **User skills**: `~/.ripperdoc/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
2. **Project skills**: `.ripperdoc/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

## Using Skills

Load a skill during a session:

```
> /skill pdf
```

Or invoke via the Skill tool:

```
Load the pdf skill to process this document
```

## Skill Structure

A skill is a directory containing `SKILL.md`:

```
~/.ripperdoc/skills/pdf/
├── SKILL.md
└── reference.md (optional)
```

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: pdf
description: Process and extract content from PDF files
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Bash
model: main
max-thinking-tokens: 8000

## Project-Specific Skills

Create project skills in `.ripperdoc/skills/`:

```
.ripperdoc/

        └── SKILL.md
```

Project skills override user skills with the same name.
