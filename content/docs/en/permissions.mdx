description: Understanding and configuring the permission system

Ripperdoc includes a permission system to protect against unintended operations.

## How Permissions Work

By default, Ripperdoc prompts for approval before:

- Executing shell commands
- Editing or writing files
- Running potentially destructive operations

When a permission prompt appears, you can:

- **y/yes**: Allow the operation
- **n/no**: Deny the operation
- **a/always**: Always allow this type of operation

## YOLO Mode

Skip all permission prompts with YOLO mode:

```bash
ripperdoc --yolo
```

**Warning**: Use YOLO mode only in trusted environments where you're comfortable with the AI making changes without confirmation.

## Permission Rules

Configure permission rules in `.ripperdoc/config.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "mode": "default",
    "rules": [
      {
        "tool": "Bash",
        "pattern": "npm test",
        "action": "allow"
      },
      {
        "tool": "Edit",
        "path": "*.md",
        "action": "allow"
      },
      {
        "tool": "Bash",
        "pattern": "rm -rf",
        "action": "deny"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Rule Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `tool` | Tool name to match |
| `pattern` | Command or path pattern (supports glob) |
| `action` | `allow`, `deny`, or `ask` |

### Rule Actions

- **allow**: Automatically approve matching operations
- **deny**: Automatically reject matching operations
- **ask**: Always prompt for this operation

## Read-Only Operations

Some operations are automatically allowed as read-only:

- `Glob` - Finding files
- `Grep` - Searching content
- `Read` - Reading files
- `LS` - Listing directories
- Shell commands: `ls`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `grep`, `find` (without redirects)

## Sandbox Mode

The Bash tool supports sandbox mode for read-only shell operations:

```json
{
  "command": "ls -la",
  "sandbox": true
}
```

Sandbox mode:
- Prevents filesystem writes
- Blocks network access
- Runs without permission prompts

## Working with Sensitive Directories

Ripperdoc will prompt for confirmation when accessing sensitive directories:

- `/usr`, `/etc`, `/bin`, `/sbin`
- System configuration directories
- Other user home directories

## Managing Permissions

Use the `/permissions` command to view and manage permissions:

```
> /permissions list
> /permissions add allow Bash "npm *"
> /permissions remove 1
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with defaults**: Use the default permission system until you understand your workflow
2. **Allow specific commands**: Create allow rules for frequently used safe commands
3. **Deny dangerous patterns**: Explicitly deny patterns like `rm -rf /`
4. **Use sandbox for exploration**: Use sandbox mode when exploring unfamiliar codebases
5. **Review before YOLO**: Only use YOLO mode after reviewing what Ripperdoc will do
