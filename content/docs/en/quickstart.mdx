title: Quickstart
description: Get up and running with Ripperdoc in 5 minutes
---

This guide will help you start using Ripperdoc in just a few minutes.

## Step 1: Install

```bash
pip install ripperdoc
```

## Step 2: Start Ripperdoc

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
ripperdoc
```

If this is your first run, Ripperdoc will guide you through setting your LLM endpoint.

## Step 3: Start Coding

Now you can interact with Ripperdoc using natural language:

```
> Explain the structure of this project

> Find all functions that handle user authentication

> Add input validation to the signup form

> Write tests for the User class
```

## Step 4: Understanding Permissions

By default, Ripperdoc will ask for permission before:
- Executing shell commands
- Editing or creating files
- Running potentially destructive operations

You can approve individual actions or use `--yolo` mode to skip prompts:

```bash
ripperdoc --yolo
```

## Common Commands

During a session, you can use slash commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation history |
| `/tools` | List available tools |
| `/status` | Show session status |
| `/cost` | Show token usage and costs |
| `/exit` | Exit the session |

## Example Session

```
$ ripperdoc

> What files are in this project?

[Ripperdoc uses the Glob tool to list files]

> Read the main.py file and explain what it does

[Ripperdoc reads the file and provides an explanation]

> Add error handling to the process_data function

[Ripperdoc asks for permission, then edits the file]
```
