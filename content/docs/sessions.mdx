Ripperdoc maintains session history to enable context-aware conversations and session resumption.

## Session Storage

Sessions are stored in `~/.ripperdoc/sessions/` as JSON files containing:

- Full conversation transcript
- Tool execution history
- Token usage and costs
- Session metadata

## Resuming Sessions

Resume a previous session:

```bash
ripperdoc --resume
```

This opens an interactive picker to select from recent sessions.

Resume a specific session:

```bash
ripperdoc --resume SESSION_ID
```

## Session Commands

### View Status

```
> /status
```

Shows current session information including:
- Message count
- Token usage
- Duration
- Tool calls

### View Statistics

```
> /stats
```

Shows detailed session statistics:
- Input/output tokens
- Cache hits
- Cost breakdown
- Tool usage breakdown

### View Costs

```
> /cost
```

Shows token usage and estimated costs.

## Context Management

### Clearing History

Clear the current conversation:

```
> /clear
```

This starts a fresh conversation while keeping the session.

### Compacting History

When the context window fills up, Ripperdoc automatically compacts the conversation by summarizing older messages.

Manually trigger compaction:

```
> /compact
```

## Session Configuration

Configure session behavior in `.ripperdoc/config.json`:

```json
{
  "memory": {
    "compact_after_turns": 50
  }
}
```

### Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `compact_after_turns` | Turns before auto-compact | 50 |

## Context Length Handling

When the context window is exceeded:

1. Ripperdoc detects the context length error
2. Automatically compacts older messages
3. Retries the request with the compacted context
4. Notifies you if compaction was performed

## Exporting Sessions

Session files are stored as JSON and can be:

- Backed up manually
- Analyzed for usage patterns
- Shared for debugging

## Best Practices

1. **Use `/clear` for new tasks**: Start fresh when switching to unrelated work
2. **Monitor `/cost` for long sessions**: Keep track of token usage
3. **Resume when interrupted**: Use `--resume` to continue interrupted work
4. **Compact proactively**: Use `/compact` if responses slow down
